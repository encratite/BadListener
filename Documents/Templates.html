		<title>BadListener Template Language</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			This is some kind of design document for the HTML template language I intend to develop for my crude C# web framework <a href="https://github.com/epicvrvs/BadListener">BadListener</a>.
			I previously used an open source implementation of Microsoft's ASP.NET Razor engine called <a href="https://github.com/Antaris/RazorEngine">RazorEngine</a>.
			I made it part of a simple MVC-like environment that I deployed on low end Linux servers using <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> and <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> (for serving static content).
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, compiling the templates was enormously slow.
			Individual .cshtml template files would often take 1500-4000 ms to process, which slowed down the startup of the server and also made testing small changes quite cumbersome.
			The engine, much like Microsoft's, generates C# source code from your templates which is then compiled and loaded as dynamic assemblies.
			AppDomains are used to isolate the template code, to protect the process to some extent.
			The slow compilation and my general interest in trying out new technology are the primary reasons I started exploring alternatives such as completely writing the template engine myself.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Goals</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Compilation should not take more than 50 ms per template file on low end Linux boxes</li>
			<li>Rendering overhead should be negligible (not more than 5 ms)</li>
			<li>Low code complexity</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Outline</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Generate bytecode using Microsoft's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.expressions.expression(v=vs.110).aspx">Expression API</a></li>
			<li>Expressions operate on models (CLR objects) returned by controllers</li>
			<li>Static typing</li>
			<li>Lisp-like prefix notation rather than C#-like infix notation</li>
			<li>Small number of built-in types</li>
			<li>Small number of operators (no binary operators, no assignment operators)</li>
			<li>Small number of other built-in functions</li>
			<li>No support for common features of high-level languages</li>
			<li>No proper user-defined functions with static type signatures, only primitive macros that emit blocks</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Examples</h1>
		
		<h2>Model</h2>
		<p>These are the C# model classes used in the examples:</p>
		<pre>
// This is the model returned by the controller
public class Addict
{
	// The name of the user
	public string Name { get; set; }
	
	// The drinks recently consumed by the user
	public List&lt;Drink&gt; Drinks { get; set; }
}

public class Drink
{
	// The time the drink was consumed
	public DateTimeOffset Time { get; set; }
	
	// The name of the drink
	public string Name { get; set; }
	
	// The amount consumed, in millilitres
	public int Amount { get; set; }
}
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Accessing Properties</h2>
		<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;@(.name model)'s Drinks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First drink: @(.name (index (.drinks model) 0))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second drink: @(.name (index (.drinks model) 1))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
		<pre>
@(if (&gt;= (count (.drinks model)) 5) (
	&lt;p&gt;@(.name model) is likely drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
) (
	&lt;p&gt;@(.name model) is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
)
		</pre>
